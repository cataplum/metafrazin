                  I love you at ten in the morning, and at eleven, and at twelve at midday. I love you with all my soul and body, sometimes, on the rainy evenings. But at two in the afternoon, or at three, when I start thinking about the two of us, and you are thinking about food or about the daily chores, or about the entertainment that you don’t have, I start silently hating you, with half of the hate that I keep for me.
                </span>
                <span>
                  Then I start loving you again, when we sleep together and I feel you are made for me, that your knee and your belly somehow tell me so, that my hands convince me of it, that there is no other place where I come from, where I go to, better than your body. Your whole self comes to my encounter, and we both disappear for a second, we enter the mouth of God, until the moment I tell you I’m hungry or I’m sleepy.
                </span>
                <span>
                  Every day I hopelessly love you and I hate you. And there are days, there are hours, when I don’t know you, when you are foreign to me like someone else’s woman. Men worry me, I worry me, my sorrows distract me. It’s possible I don’t think about you for a long time. Of course. Who could love you less than I do, my love?
